<H2> LATEST VERSION IS: 1.0.0.0 (11-07-14)</H2>
<P> <A HREF = "ogre.jar">Get the client software!</A>
<P>
<P><B>(11-07-14) this is some ugly, last-minute, seat-of-the-pants stuff</B>
<P>Unfinished, barely-documented software! Typos! Ugliness! Controls you're sure to hate!
<P>Ogre is a turn-based tabletop game originally published in 1977 by Steve Jackson Games (it was his first). I should point out that everything here is copyrighted material that does NOT belong to me. I am banking on having a tiny, basically invisible user-base to keep me safe from litigation. <P>It's my birthday! I want to share this (on-going) labor of love with you, my Facebook people. Please give it a whirl and share your feelings, experience, thoghts, whatever-- I'll probably get around to fixing it!

<H2>THE "DOCUMENTATION"</H2>
<OL>
	<LI>Register A New User: Do this first. You will be asked for a username and password, as well as an email address. THIS DATA IS NOT ENCRYPTED. At least OGRE will not spam you.</LI>
	<LI>Create A New Game: you will see a list of registered players. Choose one. This represents the last of your meaningful choices at this point. You will be taken to your new game straight away. A pre-formatted deployment has been chosen for you.</LI>
	<LI>Who Am I? Units which look like black squares are enemy units. The others are yours. If you are the Ogre, you only have the one unit for now. But wow, what a unit-- it's a killing machine.</LI>
	<LI>What Do I Do? For now? Get used to the game-- moving shooting, and killing stuff....for now. Right now, objectives and victory conditions are unchecked.</LI> 
	<LI>Controls: mousewheel up/down zoom in/out. Click to select/deselect units. RIGHT-CLICK AND HOLD to scroll around. Hey, like I said: rough. </LI>
	<LI>Move Phase: move your units about the map. Consult the (dead link?) <A HREF="ogre.pdf">manual</A>. You may undo moves using (wait for it...) the UNDO button.</LI>
	<LI>Next Phase: CLick this button to advance to the next phase. Move->Shoot->Second Move->END. Be sure you mean to click it, because you cannot undo it.
	<LI>Combat: pay attention. Click a friendly unit to reveal its firing zone. Clicking another friendly unit will show you all hexes withing their shared firing zones. AS OF V1.0.0.0: you must select all friendly units BEFORE selecting a target.
	<P>Targetting an Ogre System: when attacking an Ogre, you will be asked to select a single weapon system to be the target of your attack. Attacking is covered in the manual.
	<P>Ogre Firing: you may fire multiple Ogre weapons at a single target. See the manual.</LI>
	<LI>Once you have selected attackers and a single target, click the ATTACK button. The result of the attack will be rendered in highly-realistic and THRILLING TEXT	in the lower left. ZzZzZz.</LI>
	<LI>Second Move: GEV units (hovercrafts) are able to make a second move directly after the Shooting phase. They are the only units that may do so.</LI>
	<LI>End of Phase: is when your turn ends, your screen goes blank, and you go, "huh. That's it? WTF?" Relax. Start another game, or keep an eye on your My Games menu (hit refesh to see if you opponent has made their moves yet). </LI>
	<LI>Limitations: You may have as many games in progress with as many people as you like. You may even have multiple "open" games with the same opponent!</LI>
	<LI><B>CAUTION: if you click the close operation on the window, you will exit the game, ending your turn, wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am. Ogre will lie to you about having the option to cancel that. It's a trick-- get an ax.</B></LI>
